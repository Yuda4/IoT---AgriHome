AgriHome is using a few sensors:
ESP32 - System On Chip Microcontoller including WiFi and Bluetooth.<br />
BreadBoard and jumper cables.<br />
DHT11 - Temperature and Humidity sensor.<br />
Lamp - Color led. <br />


## Liberaries using ESP32
 *WiFi.h - This library allows ESP32 to connect your router.
 *PubSubClient.h - This library allows you to send and receive MQTT messages.
 *DHT.h - This library allows DHT11, DHT21 and DHT22 sensors for measuring temperature and humidity.
